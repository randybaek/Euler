  * Starting in the top left corner of a 2×2 grid, and only being able to move to the right and down, there are exactly
  * 6 routes to the bottom right corner. How many such routes are there through a 20×20 grid?
  *
  * easy answer is (20+20) C (20)  => 40 Combination 20  => (40*39*...21)/20! => 137846528820
  * why? ...?
  *
  * computational solution, dynamic programming.
